        3.     	Billing & Payment
        There are different methods for payment and invoicing on Casa.com.
        <p>

        a. Retainer fee
        Confirmation of a Reservation Request by a Renter may be dependent on payment of a retainer fee. This Retainer Fee is charged by Casa in the name of and to the account of the Owner, as a partial advance payment for the total amount listed in the Rental Listing. The Retainer Fee is also equal to the commission owed by the Owner to Casa for the Commission on Transactions (transaction fee) in accordance with the tables and information outlined above.

        The Services provided by Casa to facilitate and enable the rental transaction remain free for the Renter, as the Retainer Fee paid by the Renter will be deducted from the total amount listed in the Rental Listing owed by the Renter to the Owner.

        A proof of payment of this Retainer Fee is always available via the Renter’s Member Account under My Bookings.

        The Retainer Fee is charged from the Renter's account only if the corresponding Reservation Request is accepted by the Owner.

        Payment of the Retainer Fee can be made online via credit card, a Paypal account or a ClickandBuy account.
        <p>

        b.     	Billing
        Invoicing information and billing payment are available online in the  My Bills  section of your Member Account. The invoices history is available online in your Member Account (My Invoices section within My Bills). The Member accepts this process for receiving invoices.

        When you choose automatic payment of your online bills, you can set how frequently invoices get published in your Member Account area.

        Once the Item is published on the Site through your Member Account, the listing fees are due and an invoice is sent to your Member Account, accessible in the section My Invoices. The invoices for listing fees correspond to the publication of your Rental Listing on the Site for a period of 3 months. These fees are due and an invoice is automatically sent for each 3 month period the Rental Listing remains published, until the Rental Listing is no longer published.

        Seven (7) days before expiration of the current 3 month publication period, We will remind you about the listing fee by sending you an email and posting a reminder in the welcome menu of your Member Account.

        In no case may the listing fees be cancelled or modified pro rata, in particular in situations where a Member Account has been terminated and/or cancelled. .

        You always have the possibility of removing the Rental Listing for an Item during its 3 month period of publication, or of pausing the Rental Listing.

        When your Rental Listing is deleted before the end of the 3 month listing period, the current listing fee is still applied for the full 3 month period and future listing fees invoice renewals are automatically cancelled.

        If a Rental Listing is deleted, or not renewed at the end of the 3 month listing period, the publication of a new Rental Listing corresponding to the same Item will be subject to new listing fees and a new 3 months listing period will begin.

        The pause function (which keeps a Rental Listing online but does not allow Reservation Requests) does not stop or discontinue the listing period for which listing fees are due.

        Reactivation of a paused Rental Listing is free.

        If an invoice has not been paid within the required timeframe, your Rental Listing will be paused until the invoice has been paid.

        In cases where the commission is paid directly by the Owner, via an invoice to his Member Account, this commission is due from the Owner by the end of the rental period that was agreed upon by the Owner and the Renter. In these cases, the invoice will be sent for each transaction by the last day of the rental.
        <p>

        c.     	Payment Method
        There are three payment methods available to members:

        Credit card
        Paypal
        ClickandBuy
        Payments are made by clicking on the button Pay My Invoices in the My Invoices section of your account.
        <p>

        d. Payment Due Dates
        Payments of invoices issued by Casa are due within 30 calendar days of their issuance date. If a payment is not made by its due date, late fees will be applied to the Member Account.
        <p>

        e. Payment Default and Late Fees
        Late fees start being applied if an invoice has not been paid 30 calendar days after being issued.

        In case of payment default on amounts due to Casa.com, a formal notice will be sent and billed to the Member.

        If the default invoices remain unpaid following the formal notice, the amounts due will accrue late fees interest at a yearly rate of 12%. A penalty fee of 15% of the total due will also be applied, which will be added to the fees for the formal notice, and any other costs related to the recovery of the due amounts.

        During these procedures for recovering unpaid invoice amounts, the debtor will be held responsible for all the fees, legal or non-legal, without prejudice of all demands and damages and interest and other actions, including contentious ones, necessary to safeguard the interests of Casa.com.

        In addition, the member explicitly accepts that Casa.com may partially or completely suspend his Account and Service(s) until payments due are recovered. Casa may proceed with the deactivation of Service(s) which will be billed at the current applicable rate. The Member will be able to use the Services once all payments owed have been paid. If the Member does not pay the amount owed before the end of the month following suspension of that Members Account, Casa may cancel the Member Account and any transactions between Casa and that Member without any further actions being taken. However the Member will still be liable for any amounts owed.
        <p>

        f.      	Printing
        You can print your invoices by clicking on an invoice in the My Invoices section and clicking on Print Invoice.
        <p>

        g.     	Payment
        An invoice must be paid within 30 days of when it was issued to the Member Account on Casa.com.

        It is possible to set up automatic payments of your invoices at regular intervals by contacting Casa through the Contact Us ticket system.

        A minimum amount of $1 must be exceeded before Casa issues an invoice. The Member does not have to pay invoices that are less than $1.00.
        <p>

        4.     	Fees & Tax
        Members are solely liable for all the taxes, fees and commissions resulting from use of Our Services and Our Site. (See Terms of Use).

        Taxes (such as, and without limitations, sales taxes) might be applicable to your transactions whether you are an individual or entity, or whether you are an Owner or a Renter. Members are encouraged to seek tax advice from a professional. (See Terms of Use).
        <p>

        5. Cancellation
        Cancellation of a Reservation Request or of a Rental Listing can be done within the Member Account.

        The Renter may cancel a Reservation Request before it has been accepted by the Owner, at no cost. If a Retainer Fee has been requested by the Owner, this amount will not be charged to them when such a cancellation occurs.

        Once a Reservation Request has been accepted by an Owner, the Renter might still have the option to cancel the rental and the corresponding Rental Agreement, depending on the terms of the Rental Agreement. However, if a Retainer Fee has already been charged, the Renter cannot be reimbursed for it.

        If a Rental Transaction is cancelled by the Owner after having been previously accepted, the Renter can contact Casa directly via the Contact Us button if the Renter suspects bad faith or other abuse, and can otherwise leave feedback about the Owner.
        <p>

        6.     	Appeals and Invoice Disputes
        All appeal claims must be submitted by creating a ticket at the Contact Us tab.
        <p>

        7.     	Warranties and Limitation of Liability
        As agreed set forth in the Terms of Use, Casa is not responsible for any loss that may occur during usage of the Site or Services. You are encouraged to review the Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitations of Liability, and Indemnity sections of the Terms of Use.
        <p>

        8. Proof of Transactions
        The computerized records kept within Casa’s electronic data system, and maintained using reasonable security measures, will be considered as the sole proof of the communications, orders, amounts owed, and payments made between Casa and the Members.
        <p>

        9. Applicable Laws
        Casa will do its best to attain an amiable resolution in all disputes. If you are not satisfied with the method by which a dispute is resolved, and if you wish to make an appeal to a qualified tribunal, the Pricing Policy will be regulated by Belgian Law.
